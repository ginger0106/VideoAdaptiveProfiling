\section{Incremental updates}
\label{sec:transfer}

Despite the improvement by online profiling and cross-video inference
the cost of periodic profiling can still overwhelm the gain of adapting
configurations, when the update granularity is very fine-grained 
temporally (every several seconds) or spatially (no identical camera to
share the cost).
Such overhead is because so far we have assumed that the temporal 
correlation (between update intervals) and spatial correlation (across
videos) are binary: if they are identical, we will reuse the best 
configuration, but otherwise, we will profile the configurations from
scratch, which can introduce a substantial overhead.

The last technique in \name addresses this limitation by a more nuanced
model of spatial and temporal correlations between video feeds in 
different time windows, so that even if the best configuration learned 
for a video feed is not to be reused, we can use its performance profile
to guide the re-profiling of another video feed or different time
window, thus incrementally update the configurations, rather than from
scratch.
