\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we argue that video processing pipelines have to be adapted over time, otherwise they might achieve very low levels of accuracy. However, a naive re-profiling is prohibitively expensive. Instead, we present \name that uses several techniques to dramatically reduce profiling cost and also improves accuracy.
